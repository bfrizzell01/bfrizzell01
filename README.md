### About Me

I'm a recent graduate of the UBC Master of Data Science program with a deep interest in using AI and statistical modeling to make a real-world impact.

I believe machine learning and deep learning are powerful tools that can help solve some of the most pressing challenges of our time - including **climate change**, **poverty**, and **mental health**. As part of a collaborative project with the **Canada Forest Service**, I developed deep learning models to assist in [monitoring the health of afforestation sites in Ontario](https://github.com/ptompalski/MDSAfforestationMonitoring) — an effort aimed at improving reforestation outcomes and ecological resilience.

But it's not all serious work! I also love building **fun, creative side projects** that reflect my personal interests - from music to games and everything in between.
