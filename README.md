### About Me

I'm a recent graduate from the UBC Master of Data Science program. My passion is to use cutting-edge AI and statistical modelling to tackle the most critical problems in our world, like climate change, poverty, and mental health. I recently worked with the Canada Forest Service to develop deep learning models to assist in [monitoring the health of afforestation sites in Ontario.](https://github.com/ptompalski/MDSAfforestationMonitoring)
